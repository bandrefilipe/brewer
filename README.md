A study project based on web software development aimed at practicing a wide range of technologies, libraries, patterns and best practices.

## Getting Started
(work pending)

## Architecture
The application is organized in multiple modules put together to implement a software architectural design called _"Ports & Adapters"_, or simply _"Hexagonal Architecture"_.

The main feature of the Hexagonal Architecture, as opposed to the commonly used layered architecture style, is that the dependencies between our components point "inward", towards our domain objects.

<img alt="Hexagonal Architecture" src="https://reflectoring.io/assets/img/posts/spring-hexagonal/hexagonal-architecture.png"/>

The hexagon is just a fancy way to describe the core of the application that is made up of domain objects, use cases that operate on them, and input and output ports that provide an interface to the outside "world" (the adapters).

### Modules
The application is divided in multiple modules, following the aforementioned hexagonal architecture.

- [brewer-api](./adapters/brewer-api/README.md "brewer-api")
  > An adapter that exposes REST endpoints to consumers of our application
- [brewer-application](./brewer-application/README.md "brewer-application")
  > Holds classes that make up the core of the application: services that implement use cases which query and modify the domain model
- [brewer-commons](./brewer-commons/README.md "brewer-commons")
  > Provides common utility functionalities that can be accessed and used by all other modules
- [brewer-configuration](./brewer-configuration/README.md "brewer-configuration")
  > Actual Spring Boot application (main class) and any Spring Java Configuration that puts together the Spring application context. To create the application context, it needs access to the other modules, which each provides certain parts of the application
- [brewer-persistence](./adapters/brewer-persistence/README.md "brewer-persistence")
  > An adapter that implements the persistence layer of the application
- [brewer-web](./adapters/brewer-web/README.md "brewer-web")
  > An adapter for the web layer of the application, which call the use cases implemented in the application's core
